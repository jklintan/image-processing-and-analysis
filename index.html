            <h4>Chain Codes</h4>
            <p>
                Chain codes is a way of representing the boundary of an object. The directions is represented according to the following two images 
                (depending on if we are looking on 4-connectivity or 8-connectivity)
            </p>
            
            <img src="./assets/img/connectivity.png"/>

            <p>
                Since chain code is dependent of the starting position this makes it harder to compare the chain code but we solve this by normalization. 
                To normalize, we consider the chain code to be circular and chooses the sequence that gives the smallest integer (rotation of the code).
            </p>

            <p class ="example">
                <h5> Example normalization </h5>
                Chain code: 202100206565444
                <br/>
                Normalized chain code: 002065654442921
            </p>

            <p>
                To further being able to compare the chain code and see if objects are the same, we want to make the chain code independent of the rotation of the object.
                To do this, we look at the first difference of the chain code. The first difference is the number of directions that separate two adjacent elements of the code. 
            </p>

            <p class="example"> 
                <h5>Example first difference, 8-chain</h5>
                Given a 8-chain code: 202100206565444. The first difference is calculated by taking two numbers at a time and counting the number of positions required to reach the second number from the first number, 
                in the counter clockwise direction.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Take the first 2 numbers, to get to 0 from 2, we take 6 steps (2-3-4-5-6-7-0). Next we have 0 to 2, that is 2 steps (0-1-2). Continuing this process gives us the first difference of the chain code: 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Chain code: 202100206565444
                <br/>
                First difference: 62770266717700
                <br/>
                Normalized: 02667177006277
            </p>

            <p class="example"> 
                    <h5>Example first difference, 4-chain</h5>
                    Given a 4-chain code: 03032211. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Take the first 2 numbers, to get to 3 from 0, we take 3 steps (0-1-2-3). Next we have 3 to 0, that is 1 step (3-0). Continuing this process gives us the first difference of the chain code: 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Chain code: 03032211
